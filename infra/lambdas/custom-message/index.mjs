/**
 * Cognito CustomMessage trigger — replaces the plain-text invite and sign-up-confirmation emails
 * with the designed HTML in `email-template.mjs`, and adds a link to the app when its URL is known.
 *
 * This file is the plumbing — which message type, where the app URL comes from, what happens when
 * something breaks. The copy and the HTML live in `email-template.mjs`.
 *
 * Two properties this file must keep, because it sits on the critical path of both `AdminCreateUser`
 * and `SignUp` — if this function throws, the operation that triggered the email fails with it:
 *
 *   1. It handles only the trigger sources it knows about and returns every other one untouched, so
 *      forgot-password and MFA messages keep using the pool's own configured templates.
 *   2. Everything is wrapped: any unexpected shape or bug falls through to the event unchanged,
 *      which means the pool's plain-text fallback template goes out instead of the operation failing.
 *
 * Plain `.mjs` with no third-party imports on purpose — it needs no bundler, no dependencies and no
 * build step, so it cannot drift from what is deployed. `@aws-sdk/client-ssm` is imported lazily from
 * the Lambda Node.js 22 runtime's bundled AWS SDK v3, not from a dependency this asset ships.
